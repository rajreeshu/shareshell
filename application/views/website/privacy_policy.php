                                            "cookies", or similar electronic tools to collect Information to assign each
                                            visitor a unique, random number as a User Identification (User ID) to
                                            understand the User's individual interests using the identified computer or

                                            example), we will have no way of knowing who you are, even if we assign a
                                            cookie to your computer or device. The only personal information a cookie
                                            can contain is information you supply. A cookie cannot read data off your

                                            your browser (if you click on their ads etc.), a process that we do not
                                            control. We receive and store certain types of Information whenever you

                                            If a User opts out using the Ads Settings, the unique DoubleClick cookie ID
                                            on the User's browser is overwritten with the phrase "OPT_OUT". Because
                                            there is no longer a unique cookie ID, the opt-out cookie can't be
